## Problem Description

A Fortune 100 company, Liberty Mutual Insurance has provided a wide range of insurance products and services designed to meet their customers' ever-changing needs for over 100 years.

To ensure that Liberty Mutualâ€™s portfolio of home insurance policies aligns with their business goals, many newly insured properties receive a home inspection. These inspections review the condition of key attributes of the property, including things like the foundation, roof, windows and siding. The results of an inspection help Liberty Mutual determine if the property is one they want to insure.

In this project, your task is to predict a transformed count of hazards or pre-existing damages using a dataset of property information. This will enable Liberty Mutual to more accurately identify high risk homes that require additional examination to confirm their insurability.

### Data Description

Each row in the dataset corresponds to a property that was inspected and given a hazard score ("Hazard"). You can think of the hazard score as a continuous number that represents the condition of the property as determined by the inspection. Some inspection hazards are major and contribute more to the total score, while some are minor and contribute less. The total score for a property is the sum of the individual hazards.

The aim of the competition is to forecast the hazard score based on anonymized variables which are available before an inspection is ordered.
